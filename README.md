## ðŸ“Š Sorting Visualization Project

A sorting algorithm visualizer with features to set speed, size and animations.

## Algorithms Used
#### Bubble Sort
- Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
#### Insertion Sort
- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
#### Selection Sort
- The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
#### Heap Sort
- Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

## Technologies Used

## Setup

To run this project locally, you'll need some prerequisites programs.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

After cloning this repository & have the required programs installed. Open a command prompt on the folder and run:

```
npm install
```

Refers to [`package.json`](https://github.com/kobito-kun/Sorting-Visualizer/blob/master/package.json) to install the required packages / libraries for this project to be able to run.

After all the above is done. Run

```
npm run
```

Which will start a local http server at [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/). Done! You have this project running locally on your network!
